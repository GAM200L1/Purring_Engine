`Purring_Engine` is a simple but effective custom 2D game engine, developed using C++ with OpenGL for rendering.
The engine includes:
- A level editor
- Component-based architecture
- Sprite batching and instancing
- Custom algorithms for physics and collision detection
</br>

This engine was designed to support the development of _**March of the Meows**_, a 2D turn-based strategy game with a real-time twist. More details about our game can be [found below](#March-of-the-Meows).

## Setting it Up
Follow these steps to get the Purring Engine up and running:
1. Unzip the `vendor.zip` file directly into the root folder by selecting "Extract Here".
2. Double-click the `GenerateProject.bat` file to run it.
3. Open the `Purring_Engine.sln` file with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

After completing these steps, your file directory should look like this:
