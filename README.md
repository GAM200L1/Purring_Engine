A simple but effective custom 2D game engine, built using C++ with OpenGL for rendering.
Our engine features a level editor, a component-based architecture, sprite batching and instancing, and custom algorithms for physics and collision detection.
</br>

This engine was designed to support the development of "March of the Meows", our turn-based strategy game with a real-time twist. More details about our game can be [found below](#March-of-the-Meows).
